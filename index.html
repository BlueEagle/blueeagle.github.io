                It has been a while since I've even looked over this site. To be honest, I was sort of cringing at the lack of dynamics offered by the static site hosting it is platformed on.
                See, I hosted this on Github Pages the day I discovered Pages exist. If I had known from the beginning that it only allowed me to use one page for the whole site and it lacks a number of basic features I would have decided to go with a more established host.
                I am currently working on building a replacement for this site that I will have hosted elsewhere and I'm thinking to use Flask to build templates for it. This site was built almost from scratch excepting some imports from bootstrap for style. I'm not stylish, at least Bootstrap is!

              In the long adventure of learning, testing, breaking, fixing, learning, testing, and implementing, 
              I eventually decided most features I'm looking to implement will be outside of this site. It will 
              still be a playground for my learning the limits of a static site. It's future replacement will 
              feature a robust backend with plenty of web apps to serve you and I both! I'm optimistic that between 
              college and learning on the side I will be able to keep moving forward and see through the completion 
              of this site as well as the some <a href="https://github.com/BlueEagle/scripts">side projects</a> I have in the works.
